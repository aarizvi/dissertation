I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my adviser Dr. Lara Sucheston-Campbell. She has been an incredible mentor for me and has set me up with any and every opportunity that I had my eyes set on. 

I am forever indebted to Dr. Barbara Foster, for taking a chance on me and giving me the opportunity to get an interview for the PhD program at RPCI, at the eleventh hour before the academic year began in 2015.

Thank you to Dr. Martin Morgan for taking time out of his extremely busy schedule to work with me one-on-one and teach me the inner workings of R.

I would not have gone done the road of computational biology/bioinformatics if it were not for two very important mentors of mine: Dr. Moray Campbell and Dr. Sebastiano Battaglia. Dr. Campbell set me up with a life defining opprtunity: the Cancer and Systems Biology program at the University of Luxembourg and VU University Amsterdam. And Dr. Battaglia for his mentorship during my Master's thesis.

And thank you to Ezgi Karaesmen -- if it were not for you, I truly believe I would not had the level of success I have had for past four years. Your love, your support, your intelligence, and your ability to challenge me on my scientific thought, my coding, and my ability to think have been instrumental to me and I cannot thank you enough.
