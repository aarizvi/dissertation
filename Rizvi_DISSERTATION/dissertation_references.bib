	Abstract = {PhenoScanner is a curated database of publicly available results from large-scale genetic association studies. This tool aims to facilitate 'phenome scans', the cross-referencing of genetic variants with many phenotypes, to help aid understanding of disease pathways and biology. The database currently contains over 350 million association results and over 10 million unique genetic variants, mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms. It is accompanied by a web-based tool that queries the database for associations with user-specified variants, providing results according to the same effect and non-effect alleles for each input variant. The tool provides the option of searching for trait associations with proxies of the input variants, calculated using the European samples from 1000 Genomes and Hapmap.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PhenoScanner is available at www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk CONTACT: jrs95@medschl.cam.ac.ukSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the transcript levels of genes STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A and STAT5B in the diagnostic samples of childhood ALL patients and compared them to those of healthy controls in order to characterize STAT gene expression in childhood ALL. As compared to controls, ALL patients exhibit markedly decreased transcript levels in all four genes investigated. STAT1 and STAT3 are significantly correlated in ALL patients as opposed to controls (P<0.0005). Patients with low transcript levels of STAT1 and STAT3 survive, regardless of minimal residual disease status and relapse. Lower transcript levels appear in association with a particularly high survival outcome in the ALL patients. The identification of aberrant expression profiles provides insight into the role of STAT genes in the development of childhood ALL and enables development of patient-tailored therapeutic approaches in cases of resistant disease.},

	Abstract = {Glucocorticoid resistance is a major driver of therapeutic failure in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here, we identify the AKT1 kinase as a major negative regulator of the NR3C1 glucocorticoid receptor protein activity driving glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL. Mechanistically, AKT1 impairs glucocorticoid-induced gene expression by direct phosphorylation of NR3C1 at position S134 and blocking glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation to the nucleus. Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of PTEN and consequent AKT1 activation can effectively block glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and induce resistance to glucocorticoid therapy. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of AKT with MK2206 effectively restores glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation to the nucleus, increases the response of T-ALL cells to glucocorticoid therapy, and effectively reverses glucocorticoid resistance in vitro and in vivo.},

@article{McMaster_2008,
	Abstract = {Glucocorticoid hormones exert a wide spectrum of metabolic and immunological effects. They function through the glucocorticoid receptor, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Glucocorticoids are particularly effective as anti-inflammatory agents but often cause severe side effects. The structure of the ligand-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor has now been elucidated, and a series of studies have shown that even subtle changes to the ligand structure alter the final conformation of the ligand-receptor complex, with consequences for both protein recruitment and the function of the receptor. This has led to concerted efforts to find selective ligands for the glucocorticoid receptor that preserve the beneficial anti-inflammatory activity but reduce the side-effect profile. The direct health-care benefits of such a simple, safe, orally active agent targeting the underlying inflammatory process in, for example, rheumatoid arthritis would be considerable in terms of reduced patient suffering; furthermore, the indirect benefits in terms of reducing the costs of therapeutic delivery and preventing loss of productivity would be even greater.},

@article{Guerzoni_2006,
	Abstract = {Translational regulation by oncogenic proteins may be a rapid and efficient mechanism to modulate gene expression. We report here the identification of the CEBPB gene as a target of translational regulation in myeloid precursor cells transformed by the BCR/ABL oncogene. Expression of CEBPB was repressed in 32D-BCR/ABL cells and reinduced by imatinib (STI571) via a mechanism that appears to depend on expression of the CUG-repeat RNA-binding protein CUGBP1 and the integrity of the CUG-rich intercistronic region of c/ebpbeta mRNA. Constitutive expression or conditional activation of wild-type CEBPB induced differentiation and inhibited proliferation of 32D-BCR/ABL cells in vitro and in mice, but a DNA binding-deficient CEBPB mutant had no effect. The proliferation-inhibitory effect of CEBPB was, in part, mediated by the CEBPB-induced GADD45A gene. Because expression of CEBPB (and CEBPA) is low in the blast crisis (BC) stage of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and is inversely correlated with BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase levels, these findings point to the therapeutic potential of restoring C/EBP activity in CML-BC and, perhaps, other types of acute leukemia.},

	Abstract = {CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (CEBP) transcription factors play pivotal roles in proliferation and differentiation, including suppression of myeloid leukemogenesis. Mutations of CEBPA are found in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in some cases of familial AML. Here, using cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and molecular cloning, we show that 5 CEBP gene family members are targeted by recurrent IGH chromosomal translocations in BCP-ALL. Ten patients with t(8;14)(q11;q32) involved CEBPD on chromosome 8, and 9 patients with t(14;19)(q32;q13) involved CEBPA, while a further patient involved CEBPG, located 71 kb telomeric of CEBPA in chromosome band 19q13; 4 patients with inv(14)(q11q32)/t(14;14)(q11;q32) involved CEBPE and 3 patients with t(14;20)(q32;q13) involved CEBPB. In 16 patients the translocation breakpoints were cloned using long-distance inverse-polymerase chain reaction (LDI-PCR). With the exception of CEBPD breakpoints, which were scattered within a 43-kb region centromeric of CEBPD, translocation breakpoints were clustered immediately 5' or 3' of the involved CEBP gene. Except in 1 patient with t(14;14)(q11;q32), the involved CEBP genes retained germ-line sequences. Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR showed overexpression of the translocated CEBP gene. Our findings implicate the CEBP gene family as novel oncogenes in BCP-ALL, and suggest opposing functions of CEBP dysregulation in myeloid and lymphoid leukemogenesis.},

	Abstract = {Genome sequencing projects are discovering millions of genetic variants in humans, and interpretation of their functional effects is essential for understanding the genetic basis of variation in human traits. Here we report sequencing and deep analysis of messenger RNA and microRNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines of 462 individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project--the first uniformly processed high-throughput RNA-sequencing data from multiple human populations with high-quality genome sequences. We discover extremely widespread genetic variation affecting the regulation of most genes, with transcript structure and expression level variation being equally common but genetically largely independent. Our characterization of causal regulatory variation sheds light on the cellular mechanisms of regulatory and loss-of-function variation, and allows us to infer putative causal variants for dozens of disease-associated loci. Altogether, this study provides a deep understanding of the cellular mechanisms of transcriptome variation and of the landscape of functional variants in the human genome.},

	Abstract = {Genetic variation influences gene expression, and this variation in gene expression can be efficiently mapped to specific genomic regions and variants. Here we have used gene expression profiling of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines of all 270 individuals genotyped in the HapMap Consortium to elucidate the detailed features of genetic variation underlying gene expression variation. We find that gene expression is heritable and that differentiation between populations is in agreement with earlier small-scale studies. A detailed association analysis of over 2.2 million common SNPs per population (5% frequency in HapMap) with gene expression identified at least 1,348 genes with association signals in cis and at least 180 in trans. Replication in at least one independent population was achieved for 37% of cis signals and 15% of trans signals, respectively. Our results strongly support an abundance of cis-regulatory variation in the human genome. Detection of trans effects is limited but suggests that regulatory variation may be the key primary effect contributing to phenotypic variation in humans. We also explore several methodologies that improve the current state of analysis of gene expression variation.},

It is well known that such an approach is suboptimal, but it persists in part because results are easy to interpret after categorization. Splines may be used to incorporate continuous predictors with smoothed curves into regression models without categorization or linearity assumptions. Properly presenting and interpreting results from analyses with splines is critical for their widespread use. With data from 13,706 antiretroviral initiators in Latin America, we demonstrate how to interpret results from a Cox regression model using restricted cubic splines.},

Here we derive a mathematical expression to compute PrediXcan (a gene mapping approach) results using summary data (S-PrediXcan) and show its accuracy and general robustness to misspecified reference sets. We apply this framework to 44 GTEx tissues and 100+ phenotypes from GWAS and meta-analysis studies, creating a growing public catalog of associations that seeks to capture the effects of gene expression variation on human phenotypes. Replication in an independent cohort is shown. Most of the associations are tissue specific, suggesting context specificity of the trait etiology. Colocalized significant associations in unexpected tissues underscore the need for an agnostic scanning of multiple contexts to improve our ability to detect causal regulatory mechanisms. Monogenic disease genes are enriched among significant associations for related traits, suggesting that smaller alterations of these genes may cause a spectrum of milder phenotypes.},

	Abstract = {G(2)/M progression requires coordinated expression of many gene products, but little is known about the transcriptional regulators involved. We recently identified human Cdc5, a positive regulator of G(2)/M in mammalian cells. We also demonstrated the presence of a latent activation domain in its carboxyl terminus, suggesting that human Cdc5 regulates G(2)/M through transcriptional activation. Despite the presence of a DNA binding domain, studies by others have failed to identify a preferential binding site for Cdc5 family members. In addition, Cdc5 recently has been associated with the splicesome in several organisms, suggesting that it may not act through DNA binding. We now report the identification of a 12 bp sequence to which human Cdc5 binds specifically and with high affinity through its amino terminus. We show that this DNA-protein interaction is capable of activating transcription. We also used a selection system in yeast to identify human genomic fragments that interact with human Cdc5. Several of these contained sequences similar to the binding site. We demonstrate that these bind human Cdc5 with similar specificity and affinity. These experiments provide the first evidence that Cdc5 family members can act as site-specific DNA binding proteins, and that human Cdc5 may interact with specific, low abundance sequences in the human genome. This raises the possibility that Cdc5 proteins may participate in more than one process necessary for regulated cell division.},

	Abstract = {{The incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) in adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients (age range, 15-39 years) in the United States is increasing at a greater rate than in younger or older persons. Their optimal treatment has been increasingly debated as pediatric regimens have become more widely used in the age group. This review compares the basic features of pediatric and adult chemotherapy regimens for ALL and LBL, recognizes and describes the challenges of the pediatric regimen, and suggests strategies to facilitate its adoption for AYAs with ALL and LBL.All but 2 of 25 published comparisons of outcomes with pediatric and adult regimens for ALL and LBL in AYAs and 1 meta-analysis favor the pediatric regimen. After more than a half-century of clinical trials of the pediatric regimens, including at least 160 phase 3 trials in the United States, the pediatric regimens have become far more complex than most adult regimens. Asparaginase, a critical component of the pediatric regimens, is more difficult to administer to AYAs (and older patients) but nonetheless has a favorable benefit to toxicity ratio for AYAs. A dramatic reduction in outcome of ALL and LBL during the AYA years (the ``survival cliff'') is coincident with similar reductions in proportions of AYAs referred to academic centers and enrolled on clinical trials (the ``accrual cliff'' and ``referral cliff'').The accumulating data increasingly support treating AYAs with ALL and LBL with a pediatric-inspired regimen or an approved institutional or national clinical trial tailored for this patient group. A need to develop clinical trials specifically for AYAs and to encourage their participation is paramount, with a goal to improve both the quantity and quality of survival.}},

@article{Huguet_2009,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Retrospective comparisons have suggested that adolescents or teenagers with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) benefit from pediatric rather than adult chemotherapy regimens. Thus, the aim of the present phase II study was to test a pediatric-inspired treatment, including intensified doses of nonmyelotoxic drugs, such as prednisone, vincristine, or L-asparaginase, in adult patients with ALL up to the age of 60 years.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2003 and 2005, 225 adult patients (median age, 31 years; range, 15 to 60 years) with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL were enrolled onto the Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 2003 protocol, which included several pediatric options. Some adult options, such as allogeneic stem-cell transplantation for patients with high-risk ALL, were nevertheless retained.
RESULTS: were retrospectively compared with the historical France-Belgium Group for Lymphoblastic Acute Leukemia in Adults 94 (LALA-94) trial experience in 712 patients age 15 to 55 years. Results Complete remission rate was 93.5%. At 42 months, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 55% (95% CI, 48% to 52%) and 60% (95% CI, 53% to 66%), respectively. Age remained an important bad prognostic factor, with 45 years of age as best cutoff. In older versus younger patients, there was a higher cumulative incidence of chemotherapy-related deaths (23% v 5%, respectively; P < .001) and deaths in first CR (22% v 5%, respectively; P < .001), whereas the incidence of relapse remained stable (30% v 32%, respectively). Complete remission rate (P = .02), EFS (P < .001), and OS (P < .001) compared favorably with the previous LALA-94 experience.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that pediatric-inspired therapy markedly improves the outcome of adult patients with ALL, at least until the age of 45 years.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To review the impact of collaborative studies on advances in the biology and treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children and adolescents.
METHODS: A review of English literature on childhood ALL focusing on collaborative studies was performed. The resulting article was reviewed and revised by the committee chairs of the major ALL study groups.
RESULTS: With long-term survival rates for ALL approaching 90% and the advent of high-resolution genome-wide analyses, several international study groups or consortia were established to conduct collaborative research to further improve outcome. As a result, treatment strategies have been improved for several subtypes of ALL, such as infant, MLL-rearranged, Philadelphia chromosome-positive, and Philadelphia chromosome-like ALL. Many recurrent genetic abnormalities that respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and multiple genetic determinants of drug resistance and toxicities have been identified to help develop targeted therapy. Several genetic polymorphisms have been recognized that show susceptibility to developing ALL and that help explain the racial/ethnic differences in the incidence of ALL.
CONCLUSION: The information gained from collaborative studies has helped decipher the heterogeneity of ALL to help improve personalized treatment, which will further advance the current high cure rate and the quality of life for children and adolescents with ALL.},

	Abstract = {Although plasma proteins have important roles in biological processes and are the direct targets of many drugs, the genetic factors that control inter-individual variation in plasma protein levels are not well understood. Here we characterize the genetic architecture of the human plasma proteome in healthy blood donors from the INTERVAL study. We identify 1,927 genetic associations with 1,478 proteins, a fourfold increase on existing knowledge, including trans associations for 1,104 proteins. To understand the consequences of perturbations in plasma protein levels, we apply an integrated approach that links genetic variation with biological pathway, disease, and drug databases. We show that protein quantitative trait loci overlap with gene expression quantitative trait loci, as well as with disease-associated loci, and find evidence that protein biomarkers have causal roles in disease using Mendelian randomization analysis. By linking genetic factors to diseases via specific proteins, our analyses highlight potential therapeutic targets, opportunities for matching existing drugs with new disease indications, and potential safety concerns for drugs under development.},

	Abstract = {Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer, and despite cure rates exceeding 90% in children, it remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children and adults. The past decade has been marked by extraordinary advances into the genetic basis of leukemogenesis and treatment responsiveness in ALL. Both B-cell and T-cell ALL comprise multiple subtypes harboring distinct constellations of somatic structural DNA rearrangements and sequence mutations that commonly perturb lymphoid development, cytokine receptors, kinase and Ras signaling, tumor suppression, and chromatin modification. Recent studies have helped to understand the genetic basis of clonal evolution and relapse and the role of inherited genetic variants in leukemogenesis. Many of these findings are of clinical importance, and ongoing studies implementing clinical sequencing in the management of leukemia are expected to improve diagnosis, monitoring of residual disease, and early detection of relapse and to guide precise therapies. Here, we provide a concise review of genomic studies in ALL and discuss the role of genomic testing in clinical management.},

	Abstract = {The causes of individual relapses in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remain incompletely understood. We evaluated the contribution of germline genetic factors to relapse in 2225 children treated on Children's Oncology Group trial AALL0232. We identified 302 germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with relapse after adjusting for treatment and ancestry and 715 additional SNPs associated with relapse in an ancestry-specific manner. We tested for replication of these relapse-associated SNPs in external data sets of antileukemic drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and an independent clinical cohort. 224 SNPs were associated with rapid drug clearance or drug resistance, and 32 were replicated in the independent cohort. The adverse risk associated with black and Hispanic ancestries was attenuated by addition of the 4 SNPs most strongly associated with relapse in these populations (for blacks: model without SNPs hazard ratio (HR)=2.32, P=2.27 × 10-4, model with SNPs HR=1.07, P=0.79; for Hispanics: model without SNPs HR=1.7, P=8.23 × 10-5, model with SNPs HR=1.31, P=0.065). Relapse SNPs associated with asparaginase resistance or allergy were overrepresented among SNPs associated with relapse in the more asparaginase intensive treatment arm (20/54 in Capizzi-methorexate arm vs 8/54 in high-dose methotrexate arm, P=0.015).

Associations with metabolic traits as functional intermediates can overcome these problems and potentially inform individualized therapy. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of genotype-dependent metabolic phenotypes using a GWAS with non-targeted metabolomics. We identified 37 genetic loci associated with blood metabolite concentrations, of which 25 show effect sizes that are unusually high for GWAS and account for 10-60% differences in metabolite levels per allele copy. Our associations provide new functional insights for many disease-related associations that have been reported in previous studies, including those for cardiovascular and kidney disorders, type 2 diabetes, cancer, gout, venous thromboembolism and Crohn's disease. The study advances our knowledge of the genetic basis of metabolic individuality in humans and generates many new hypotheses for biomedical and pharmaceutical research.},

@article{sung_2015,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are among the most significant health problems in the United States. Blood pressure (BP) variability has a genetic component, and most of the genetic variance remains to be identified. One promising strategy for gene discovery is genome-wide analysis of interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and environmental factors related to cardiovascular diseases.
METHODS: We investigated SNP-smoking interaction effects on BP in genome-wide data in 6,889 participants from the Framingham Heart Study. We performed the standard 1 degree of freedom (df) test of the interaction effect and the joint 2 df test of main and interaction effects. Three smoking measures were used: cigarettes per day (CPD), pack years of smoking, and smoking status.
RESULTS: We identified 7 significant and 21 suggestive BP loci. Identified through the joint 2 df test, significant SBP loci include: rs12149862 (P = 3.65×10(-9)) in CYB5B, rs2268365 (P = 4.85×10(-8)) in LRP2, rs133980 (P = 1.71×10(-8) with CPD and P = 1.07×10(-8) with pack-years) near MN1, and rs12634933 (P = 4.05×10(-8)) in MECOM. Through 1 df interaction analysis, 1 suggestive SBP locus at SNP rs8010717 near NRXN3 was identified using all 3 smoking measures (P = 3.27×10(-7) with CPD, P = 1.03×10(-7) with pack-years, and P = 1.19×10(-7) with smoking status).
CONCLUSIONS: Several of these BP loci are biologically plausible, providing physiological connection to BP regulation. Our study demonstrates that SNP-smoking interactions can enhance gene discovery and provide insight into novel pathways and mechanisms regulating BP.},

	Abstract = {P-element-induced wimpy testis (PIWI) proteins bind to PIWI-interacting RNAs and play key roles in the biogenesis and functions of PIWI-interacting RNAs. It has been reported that PIWI proteins are essential for stem cell self-renewal and germline development in diverse organisms and that they are ectopically expressed in multiple forms of cancer. However, the role of PIWI in cancer remains elusive. Here we report that one of the four PIWI proteins in humans, PIWIL4, is highly expressed in both breast cancer tissues and the cytoplasm of MDA-MB-231 cells derived from breast cancer. Reducing PIWIL4 expression drastically impairs the migration ability of MDA-MB-231 cells, significantly increases their apoptosis, and mildly affects their proliferation. Our transcriptome and proteome analysis reveal that these functions are at least partially achieved via the PIWIL4 regulation of TGF-β and FGF signaling pathways and MHC class II proteins. These findings suggest that PIWIL4 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer. },

	Abstract = {A number of genes have been identified as members of the Argonaute family in various nonhuman organisms and these genes are considered to play important roles in the development and maintenance of germ-line stem cells. In this study, we identified the human Argonaute family, consisting of eight members. Proteins to be produced from these family members retain a common architecture with the PAZ motif in the middle and Piwi motif in the C-terminal region. Based on the sequence comparison, eight members of the Argonaute family were classified into two subfamilies: the PIWI subfamily (PIWIL1/HIWI, PIWIL2/HILI, PIWIL3, and PIWIL4/HIWI2) and the eIF2C/AGO subfamily (EIF2C1/hAGO1, EIF2C2/hAGO2, EIF2C3/hAGO3, and EIF2C4/hAGO4). PCR analysis using human multitissue cDNA panels indicated that all four members of the PIWI subfamily are expressed mainly in the testis, whereas all four members of the eIF2C/AGO subfamily are expressed in a variety of adult tissues. Immunoprecipitation and affinity binding experiments using human HEK293 cells cotransfected with cDNAs for FLAG-tagged DICER, a member of the ribonuclease III family, and the His-tagged members of the Argonaute family suggested that the proteins from members of both subfamilies are associated with DICER. We postulate that at least some members of the human Argonaute family may be involved in the development and maintenance of stem cells through the RNA-mediated gene-quelling mechanisms associated with DICER.},

Genome-wide association studies have transformed our understanding of MM predisposition, but individual studies have had limited power to discover risk loci. Here we perform a meta-analysis of these GWAS, add a new GWAS and perform replication analyses resulting in 9,866 cases and 239,188 controls.

	Abstract = {Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)-mediated transcription is an important mediator for cellular responses to DNA damage. Genotoxic agents trigger a 'nuclear-to-cytoplasmic' NF-κB activation signaling pathway; however, the early nuclear signaling cascade linking DNA damage and NF-κB activation is poorly understood. Here we report that Src-associated-substrate-during-mitosis-of-68kDa/KH domain containing, RNA binding, signal transduction associated 1 (Sam68/KHDRBS1) is a key NF-κB regulator in genotoxic stress-initiated signaling pathway. Sam68 deficiency abolishes DNA damage-stimulated polymers of ADP-ribose (PAR) production and the PAR-dependent NF-κB transactivation of anti-apoptotic genes. Sam68 deleted cells are hypersensitive to genotoxicity caused by DNA damaging agents. Upregulated Sam68 coincides with elevated PAR production and NF-κB-mediated anti-apoptotic transcription in human and mouse colon cancer. Knockdown of Sam68 sensitizes human colon cancer cells to genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis and genetic deletion of Sam68 dampens colon tumor burden in mice. Together our data reveal a novel function of Sam68 in the genotoxic stress-initiated nuclear signaling, which is crucial for colon tumorigenesis.},

	Abstract = {p53 is possibly the most important mammalian tumor suppressor and it is mutated or lost in more than half of all human cancers. The stability of p53 is primarily determined by the RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase Hdm2, which targets p53 for proteasomal degradation, restraining the potent activity of p53 and enabling cell survival and proliferation. UBE4B has been shown to physically interact with p53 and Hdm2 and to negatively regulate p53 stability and function. However, no one has determined whether UBE4B promotes p53 degradation in breast cancer. In this study, UBE4B promoted the degradation and ubiquitination of p53 to inhibit the apoptosis of cancer cells and promote tumorigenesis. Our results indicate that UBE4B regulates p53 in breast cancer and could be a viable target for developing new therapeutic strategies for breast cancer treatment. },

	Abstract = {Aberrant FHIT mRNA transcripts are present in malignant and normal haematopoiesis, but absence of FHIT protein is restricted to leukaemia Alterations of the recently cloned fragile histidine triad (FHIT) gene at chromosome 3p14.2 are frequent in a variety of solid tumours and cancer cell lines. Based on these findings, FHIT has been proposed as a putative tumour-suppressor gene. We evaluated the mRNA expression of the FHIT gene in samples from 55 patients with various haematological malignancies (21 AML, 8 CML, 10 CLL, seven low-grade and nine high-grade Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas), in a panel of 16 leukaemia cell lines, in normal mature haematopoietic cells of both myeloid and lymphoid lineage, as well as in CD34+ haematopoietic progenitor cells. Aberrant FHIT mRNA transcripts were observed in 14/16 (88%) leukaemia cell lines, 43/55 (78%) primary haematological neoplasms, but also in 17/22 (77%) normal controls. 1/16 (6%) cell lines and 7/55 (13%) neoplasms did not express any FHIT mRNA. cDNA sequencing revealed exonic deletions, small DNA insertions and combinations of both. Analysis of genomic DNA showed gene deletions in two myeloid leukaemia cell lines. In contrast to all normal types of haematopoietic cells, FHIT protein was clearly reduced or absent in 8/18 (44%) neoplastic samples tested. Our data indicate that whilst aberrant FHIT mRNA transcripts are seen both in normal and malignant cells, lack of FHIT protein is restricted to leukaemia. Absent FHIT protein expression might contribute to leukaemogenesis.},

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to comprehensively identify inherited genetic variants associated with susceptibility to AYA ALL. In the discovery GWAS, we compared genotype frequency at 635 297 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 308 AYA ALL cases and 6,661 non-ALL controls by using a logistic regression model with genetic ancestry as a covariate. SNPs that reached P ≤ 5 × 10(-8) in GWAS were tested in an independent cohort of 162 AYA ALL cases and 5,755 non-ALL controls. We identified a single genome-wide significant susceptibility locus in GATA3: rs3824662, odds ratio (OR), 1.77 (P = 2.8 × 10(-10)) and rs3781093, OR, 1.73 (P = 3.2 × 10(-9)). These findings were validated in the replication cohort. The risk allele at rs3824662 was most frequent in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like ALL but also conferred susceptibility to non-Ph-like ALL in AYAs. In 1,827 non-selected ALL cases, the risk allele frequency at this SNP was positively correlated with age at diagnosis (P = 6.29 × 10(-11)). Our results from this first GWAS of AYA ALL susceptibility point to unique biology underlying leukemogenesis and potentially distinct disease etiology by age group. },

	Abstract = {For many complex traits, genetic variants have been found associated. However, it is still mostly unclear through which downstream mechanism these variants cause these phenotypes. Knowledge of these intermediate steps is crucial to understand pathogenesis, while also providing leads for potential pharmacological intervention. Here we relied upon natural human genetic variation to identify effects of these variants on trans-gene expression (expression quantitative trait locus mapping, eQTL) in whole peripheral blood from 1,469 unrelated individuals. We looked at 1,167 published trait- or disease-associated SNPs and observed trans-eQTL effects on 113 different genes, of which we replicated 46 in monocytes of 1,490 different individuals and 18 in a smaller dataset that comprised subcutaneous adipose, visceral adipose, liver tissue, and muscle tissue. HLA single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were 10-fold enriched for trans-eQTLs: 48% of the trans-acting SNPs map within the HLA, including ulcerative colitis susceptibility variants that affect plausible candidate genes AOAH and TRBV18 in trans. We identified 18 pairs of unlinked SNPs associated with the same phenotype and affecting expression of the same trans-gene (21 times more than expected, P<10(-16)). This was particularly pronounced for mean platelet volume (MPV): Two independent SNPs significantly affect the well-known blood coagulation genes GP9 and F13A1 but also C19orf33, SAMD14, VCL, and GNG11. Several of these SNPs have a substantially higher effect on the downstream trans-genes than on the eventual phenotypes, supporting the concept that the effects of these SNPs on expression seems to be much less multifactorial. Therefore, these trans-eQTLs could well represent some of the intermediate genes that connect genetic variants with their eventual complex phenotypic outcomes.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Variability of gene expression in human may link gene sequence variability and phenotypes; however, non-genetic variations, alone or in combination with genetics, may also influence expression traits and have a critical role in physiological and disease processes.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To get better insight into the overall variability of gene expression, we assessed the transcriptome of circulating monocytes, a key cell involved in immunity-related diseases and atherosclerosis, in 1,490 unrelated individuals and investigated its association with >675,000 SNPs and 10 common cardiovascular risk factors. Out of 12,808 expressed genes, 2,745 expression quantitative trait loci were detected (P<5.78x10(-12)), most of them (90%) being cis-modulated. Extensive analyses showed that associations identified by genome-wide association studies of lipids, body mass index or blood pressure were rarely compatible with a mediation by monocyte expression level at the locus. At a study-wide level (P<3.9x10(-7)), 1,662 expression traits (13.0%) were significantly associated with at least one risk factor. Genome-wide interaction analyses suggested that genetic variability and risk factors mostly acted additively on gene expression. Because of the structure of correlation among expression traits, the variability of risk factors could be characterized by a limited set of independent gene expressions which may have biological and clinical relevance. For example expression traits associated with cigarette smoking were more strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis than smoking itself.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that the monocyte transcriptome is a potent integrator of genetic and non-genetic influences of relevance for disease pathophysiology and risk assessment.},

@article{sanda_2017,
	Abstract = {In hematopoietic cell development, the transcriptional program is strictly regulated in a lineage- and stage-specific manner that requires a number of transcription factors to work in a cascade or in a loop, in addition to interactions with nonhematopoietic cells in the microenvironment. Disruption of the transcriptional program alters the cellular state and may predispose cells to the acquisition of genetic abnormalities. Early studies have shown that proteins that promote cell differentiation often serve as tumor suppressors, whereas inhibitors of those proteins act as oncogenes in the context of acute leukemia. A prime example is T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a malignant disorder characterized by clonal proliferation of immature stage thymocytes. Although a relatively small number of genetic abnormalities are observed in T-ALL, these abnormalities are crucial for leukemogenesis. Many oncogenes and tumor suppressors in T-ALL are transcription factors that are required for normal hematopoiesis. The transformation process in T-ALL is efficient and orchestrated; the oncogene disrupts the transcriptional program directing T-cell differentiation and also uses its native ability as a master transcription factor in hematopoiesis. This imbalance in the transcriptional program is a primary determinant underlying the molecular pathogenesis of T-ALL. In this review, we focus on the oncogenic transcription factor TAL1 and the tumor-suppressor E-proteins and discuss the malignant cell state, the transcriptional circuit, and the consequence of molecular abnormalities in T-ALL.},

Understanding the motif content of these data sets is an important step in understanding the underlying mechanisms of regulation. Here we provide a systematic motif analysis for 427 human ChIP-seq data sets using motifs curated from the literature and also discovered de novo using five established motif discovery tools. We use a systematic pipeline for calculating motif enrichment in each data set, providing a principled way for choosing between motif variants found in the literature and for flagging potentially problematic data sets. Our analysis confirms the known specificity of 41 of the 56 analyzed factor groups and reveals motifs of potential cofactors. We also use cell type-specific binding to find factors active in specific conditions. The resource we provide is accessible both for browsing a small number of factors and for performing large-scale systematic analyses. We provide motif matrices, instances and enrichments in each of the ENCODE data sets. The motifs discovered here have been used in parallel studies to validate the specificity of antibodies, understand cooperativity between data sets and measure the variation of motif binding across individuals and species. },

@article{yang_2015,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: To examine the contributions of sequence and function conservation in the evolution of enhancers, we systematically identified enhancers whose sequences are not conserved among distant groups of vertebrate species, but have homologous function and are likely to be derived from a common ancestral sequence. Our approach combined comparative genomics and epigenomics to identify potential enhancer sequences in the genomes of three groups of distantly related vertebrate species.
RESULTS: We searched for sequences that were conserved within groups of closely related species but not between groups of more distant species, and were associated with an epigenetic mark of enhancer activity. To facilitate inferring orthology between non-conserved sequences, we limited our search to introns whose orthology could be unambiguously established by mapping the bracketing exons. We show that a subset of these non-conserved but syntenic sequences from the mouse and zebrafish genomes have homologous functions in a zebrafish transgenic enhancer assay. The conserved expression patterns driven by these enhancers are probably associated with short transcription factor-binding motifs present in the divergent sequences.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified numerous potential enhancers with divergent sequences but a conserved function. These results indicate that selection on function, rather than sequence, may be a common mode of enhancer evolution; evidence for selection at the sequence level is not a necessary criterion to define a gene regulatory element.},

	Abstract = {In addition to acting as building blocks for biosynthesis, amino acids might serve as signaling regulators in various physiological and pathological processes. However, it remains unknown whether amino acid levels affect the activities of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). By using a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor of the intracellular levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), we could monitor the dynamics of BCAA metabolism in HSCs. A mitochondrial-targeted 2C-type Ser/Thr protein phosphatase (PPM1K) promotes the catabolism of BCAAs to maintain MEIS1 and p21 levels by decreasing the ubiquitination-mediated degradation controlled by the E3 ubiquitin ligase CDC20. PPM1K deficiency led to a notable decrease in MEIS1/p21 signaling to reduce the glycolysis and quiescence of HSCs, followed by a severe impairment in repopulation activities. Moreover, the deletion of Ppm1k dramatically extended survival in a murine leukemia model. These findings will enhance the current understanding of nutrient signaling in metabolism and function of stem cells.},

@article{nutt_1998,
	Abstract = {The Pax-5 gene codes for the transcription factor BSAP which is essential for the progression of adult B lymphopoiesis beyond an early progenitor (pre-BI) cell stage. Although several genes have been proposed to be regulated by BSAP, CD19 is to date the only target gene which has been genetically confirmed to depend on this transcription factor for its expression. We have now taken advantage of cultured pre-BI cells of wild-type and Pax-5 mutant bone marrow to screen a large panel of B lymphoid genes for additional BSAP target genes. Four differentially expressed genes were shown to be under the direct control of BSAP, as their expression was rapidly regulated in Pax-5-deficient pre-BI cells by a hormone-inducible BSAP-estrogen receptor fusion protein. The genes coding for the B-cell receptor component Ig-alpha (mb-1) and the transcription factors N-myc and LEF-1 are positively regulated by BSAP, while the gene coding for the cell surface protein PD-1 is efficiently repressed. Distinct regulatory mechanisms of BSAP were revealed by reconstituting Pax-5-deficient pre-BI cells with full-length BSAP or a truncated form containing only the paired domain. IL-7 signalling was able to efficiently induce the N-myc gene only in the presence of full-length BSAP, while complete restoration of CD19 synthesis was critically dependent on the BSAP protein concentration. In contrast, the expression of the mb-1 and LEF-1 genes was already reconstituted by the paired domain polypeptide lacking any transactivation function, suggesting that the DNA-binding domain of BSAP is sufficient to recruit other transcription factors to the regulatory regions of these two genes. In conclusion, these loss- and gain-of-function experiments demonstrate that BSAP regulates four newly identified target genes as a transcriptional activator, repressor or docking protein depending on the specific regulatory sequence context.},

Here we report a new heterozygous germline variant, c.547G>A (p.Gly183Ser), affecting the octapeptide domain of PAX5 that was found to segregate with disease in two unrelated kindreds with autosomal dominant B-ALL. Leukemic cells from all affected individuals in both families exhibited 9p deletion, with loss of heterozygosity and retention of the mutant PAX5 allele at 9p13. Two additional sporadic ALL cases with 9p loss harbored somatic PAX5 substitutions affecting Gly183. Functional and gene expression analysis of the PAX5 mutation demonstrated that it had significantly reduced transcriptional activity. These data extend the role of PAX5 alterations in the pathogenesis of pre-B cell ALL and implicate PAX5 in a new syndrome of susceptibility to pre-B cell neoplasia. },

	Abstract = {Breast cancers are considered to be primarily regulated by estrogen signaling pathways because estrogen-dependent proliferation is observed in the majority of breast cancer cases. Thus, hormone therapy using antiestrogen drugs such as tamoxifen is effective for breast cancers expressing estrogen receptor α (ERα). However, acquired resistance during the endocrine therapy is a critical unresolved problem in breast cancer. Recently, a forkhead transcription factor FOXA1 has been reported to play an important role in the regulation of ERα-mediated transcription and proliferation of breast cancer. Interestingly, immunohistochemical analysis of breast cancer specimens has revealed that nuclear immunoreactivities of FOXP1 as well as those of FOXA1 are positively correlated with hormone receptor status, including ERα and progesterone receptor. In particular, the double-positive immunoreactivities of FOXP1 and FOXA1 are significantly associated with a favorable prognosis for survival of breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. The functions of FOXP1 and FOXA1 have been characterized in cultured cells; further, similar to FOXA1, FOXP1 is assumed to be a critical transcription factor for ERα signaling, and both forkhead transcription factors can serve as predictive factors for acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer. },

	Abstract = {The majority of trait-associated loci discovered through genome-wide association studies are located outside of known protein coding regions. Consequently, it is difficult to ascertain the mechanism underlying these variants and to pinpoint the causal alleles. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) provide an organizing principle to address both of these issues. eQTLs are genetic loci that correlate with RNA transcript levels. Large-scale data sets such as the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provide an ideal opportunity to systematically evaluate eQTLs as they have generated multiple data types on hundreds of samples. We evaluated the determinants of gene expression (germline variants and somatic copy number and methylation) and performed cis-eQTL analyses for mRNA expression and miRNA expression in five tumor types (breast, colon, kidney, lung and prostate). We next tested 149 known cancer risk loci for eQTL effects, and observed that 42 (28.2%) were significantly associated with at least one transcript. Lastly, we described a fine-mapping strategy for these 42 eQTL target-gene associations based on an integrated strategy that combines the eQTL level of significance and the regulatory potential as measured by DNaseI hypersensitivity. For each of the risk loci, our analyses suggested 1 to 81 candidate causal variants that may be prioritized for downstream functional analysis. In summary, our study provided a comprehensive landscape of the genetic determinants of gene expression in different tumor types and ranked the genes and loci for further functional assessment of known cancer risk loci. },

In this report, we provide cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) data showing that FOXP1 (3p13) is recurrently targeted by chromosome translocations. The genomic rearrangement of FOXP1 was identified by FISH in three cases with a t(3;14)(p13;q32) involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus, and in one case with a variant t(2;3) affecting sequences at 2q36. These aberrations were associated with strong expression of FOXP1 protein in tumor cells, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The cases with t(3p13) were diagnosed as DLBCL ( x 1), gastric MALT lymphoma ( x 1) and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, not otherwise specified ( x 2). Further IHC and FISH studies performed on 98 cases of DLBCL and 93 cases of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma showed a high expression of FOXP1 in approximately 13 and 12% of cases, respectively. None of these cases showed, however, FOXP1 rearrangements by FISH. However, over-representation of the FOXP1 locus found in one additional case of DLBCL may represent another potential mechanism underlying an increased expression of this gene.},

	Abstract = {{More than 90\\% of common variants associated with complex traits do not affect proteins directly, but instead the circuits that control gene expression. This has increased the urgency of understanding the regulatory genome as a key component for translating genetic results into mechanistic insights and ultimately therapeutics. To address this challenge, we developed HaploReg (http://compbio.mit.edu/HaploReg) to aid the functional dissection of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results, the prediction of putative causal variants in haplotype blocks, the prediction of likely cell types of action, and the prediction of candidate target genes by systematic mining of comparative, epigenomic and regulatory annotations. Since first launching the website in 2011, we have greatly expanded HaploReg, increasing the number of chromatin state maps to 127 reference epigenomes from ENCODE 2012 and Roadmap Epigenomics, incorporating regulator binding data, expanding regulatory motif disruption annotations, and integrating expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) variants and their tissue-specific target genes from GTEx, Geuvadis, and other recent studies. We present these updates as HaploReg v4, and illustrate a use case of HaploReg for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-associated SNPs with putative brain regulatory mechanisms.}},

@article{eagle2,
	Abstract = {Haplotype phasing is a fundamental problem in medical and population genetics. Phasing is generally performed via statistical phasing in a genotyped cohort, an approach that can yield high accuracy in very large cohorts but attains lower accuracy in smaller cohorts. Here we instead explore the paradigm of reference-based phasing. We introduce a new phasing algorithm, Eagle2, that attains high accuracy across a broad range of cohort sizes by efficiently leveraging information from large external reference panels (such as the Haplotype Reference Consortium; HRC) using a new data structure based on the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform. We demonstrate that Eagle2 attains a ∼20× speedup and ∼10% increase in accuracy compared to reference-based phasing using SHAPEIT2. On European-ancestry samples, Eagle2 with the HRC panel achieves >2× the accuracy of 1000 Genomes-based phasing. Eagle2 is open source and freely available for HRC-based phasing via the Sanger Imputation Service and the Michigan Imputation Server.},

@article{shapeit2,
	Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technologies produce short sequence reads that can contain phase information if they span two or more heterozygote genotypes. This information is not routinely used by current methods that infer haplotypes from genotype data. We have extended the SHAPEIT2 method to use phase-informative sequencing reads to improve phasing accuracy. Our model incorporates the read information in a probabilistic model through base quality scores within each read. The method is primarily designed for high-coverage sequence data or data sets that already have genotypes called. One important application is phasing of single samples sequenced at high coverage for use in medical sequencing and studies of rare diseases. Our method can also use existing panels of reference haplotypes. We tested the method by using a mother-father-child trio sequenced at high-coverage by Illumina together with the low-coverage sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP). We found that use of phase-informative reads increases the mean distance between switch errors by 22% from 274.4 kb to 328.6 kb. We also used male chromosome X haplotypes from the 1000GP samples to simulate sequencing reads with varying insert size, read length, and base error rate. When using short 100 bp paired-end reads, we found that using mixtures of insert sizes produced the best results. When using longer reads with high error rates (5-20 kb read with 4%-15% error per base), phasing performance was substantially improved. },

	Abstract = {Candidate genetic associations with acute GVHD (aGVHD) were evaluated with the use of genotyped and imputed single-nucleotide polymorphism data from genome-wide scans of 1298 allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) donors and recipients. Of 40 previously reported candidate SNPs, 6 were successfully genotyped, and 10 were imputed and passed criteria for analysis. Patient and donor genotypes were assessed for association with grades IIb-IV and III-IV aGVHD, stratified by donor type, in univariate and multivariate allelic, recessive and dominant models. Use of imputed genotypes to replicate previous IL10 associations was validated. Similar to previous publications, the IL6 donor genotype for rs1800795 was associated with a 20%-50% increased risk for grade IIb-IV aGVHD after unrelated HCT in the allelic (adjusted P = .011) and recessive (adjusted P = .0013) models. The donor genotype was associated with a 60% increase in risk for grade III-IV aGVHD after related HCT (adjusted P = .028). Other associations were found for IL2, CTLA4, HPSE, and MTHFR but were inconsistent with original publications. These results illustrate the advantages of using imputed single-nucleotide polymorphism data in genetic analyses and demonstrate the importance of validation in genetic association studies.},

	Abstract = {Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects nearly 170 million individuals worldwide. Treatment of HCV with pegylated interferon-alpha-2a is successful in eradicating virus from only 30 to 80% of those treated. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an important cytokine involved in the immune response to infectious agents and in vitro studies suggest that host genetic variation, particularly haplotypes, may affect IL-6 expression. We examined the contribution of haplotypes in the IL-6 gene on sustained viral response (SVR) to the therapy for chronic HCV infection. We observed the IL-6 T-T-G-G-G-G-C-A-G-A haplotype to be associated with a lower risk of achieving SVR among Caucasian Americans (CAs) ((relative risk) RR=0.80; 95% CI: 0.66-0.98; P=0.0261). Using a sliding window approach, the rs1800797-(G)-rs1800796-(G)-rs1800795-(G) haplotype was associated with a reduced chance of SVR (RR=0.79; 95% CI: 0.66-0.94; P=0.0081), as was the rs1800796-(G)-rs1800795-(G)-rs2069830-(C) haplotype (RR=0.78; 95% CI: 0.66-0.94; P=0.0065) among CAs. Overall, the rs1800797-(G)-rs1800796-(G)-rs1800795-(G) haplotype was independently associated with a reduced chance of SVR (RR=0.78; 95% CI: 0.62-1.0; P=0.0489) after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Our findings further illustrate the complexity of IL-6 genetic regulation and the potential importance of haplotypes on IL-6 expression. Our findings provide additional support for the potential importance of genetic variation in the IL-6 gene and the response to HCV therapy.},

	Abstract = {Proinflammatory cytokines including interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) are implicated in the pathogenesis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Cytokine gene polymorphism is associated with functional differences in cytokine regulation and altered clinical performance in a variety of diseases. Polymorphism in the IFNgammaIntron1 microsatellite (CA)n repeat has been linked with in vitro IFNgamma production and renal transplant rejection. The IL-6(-174)(G/C) single nucleotide polymorphism has been linked to in vitro and in vivo IL-6 production, juvenile chronic arthritis, and renal transplant rejection. This study examined the potential association of GVHD with IFNgamma and IL-6 polymorphisms in 80 sibling bone marrow transplant (BMT) donor/recipient pairs. Patients homozygous for the IFNgammaIntron1 allele 3 had more severe (grade III-IV) aGVHD. Patients possessing the IL-6(-174)G allele had a trend toward higher grades of aGVHD, and those homozygous for the IL-6(-174)G allele were more likely to develop chronic GVHD (cGVHD). The associations of previously identified aGVHD severity-associated cytokine gene polymorphisms (TNFd and IL-10(-1064)) with severe aGVHD were reconfirmed. Logistic regression analysis confirmed the association of severe aGVHD with recipient genotype at IFNgammaIntron1 (odds ratio [OR] 3.92; P =.02), IL-10(-1064) (OR 4.61; P =.026) and TNFd (OR 3.29; P =.039), and that of cGVHD with recipient IL-6(-174) genotype (OR 4.25; P =.007), in addition to age, gender mismatch, and underlying disease. Assessment of cytokine genotype may potentially allow more accurate prediction of GVHD and appropriate adjustment of GVHD prophylaxis, as well as indicating novel areas for future studies of GVHD pathogenesis.},

	Abstract = {Identifying the downstream effects of disease-associated SNPs is challenging. To help overcome this problem, we performed expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) meta-analysis in non-transformed peripheral blood samples from 5,311 individuals with replication in 2,775 individuals. We identified and replicated trans eQTLs for 233 SNPs (reflecting 103 independent loci) that were previously associated with complex traits at genome-wide significance. Some of these SNPs affect multiple genes in trans that are known to be altered in individuals with disease: rs4917014, previously associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), altered gene expression of C1QB and five type I interferon response genes, both hallmarks of SLE. DeepSAGE RNA sequencing showed that rs4917014 strongly alters the 3' UTR levels of IKZF1 in cis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing analysis of the trans-regulated genes implicated IKZF1 as the causal gene. Variants associated with cholesterol metabolism and type 1 diabetes showed similar phenomena, indicating that large-scale eQTL mapping provides insight into the downstream effects of many trait-associated variants. },

	Abstract = {During the past 12 years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have uncovered thousands of genetic variants that influence risk for complex human traits and diseases. Yet functional studies aimed at delineating the causal genetic variants and biological mechanisms underlying the observed statistical associations with disease risk have lagged. In this review, we highlight key advances in the field of functional genomics that may facilitate the derivation of biological meaning post-GWAS. We highlight the evidence suggesting that causal variants underlying disease risk often function through regulatory effects on the expression of target genes and that these expression effects might be modest and cell-type specific. We moreover discuss specific studies as proof-of-principle examples for current statistical, bioinformatic, and empirical bench-based approaches to downstream elucidation of GWAS-identified disease risk loci.},

	Abstract = {CTLA-4 is an inhibitory molecule that down-regulates T-cell activation. Although polymorphisms at CTLA-4 have been correlated with autoimmune diseases their association with clinical outcome after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has yet to be explored. A total of 5 CTLA-4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped on 536 HLA-identical sibling donors of allo-HSC transplants. Genotypes were tested for an association with patients' posttransplantation outcomes. The effect of the polymorphisms on cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) mRNA and protein production were determined in 60 healthy control participants. We observed a reduction in the mRNA expression of the soluble CTLA-4 isoform in the presence of a G allele at CT60 and +49. Patients receiving stem cells from a donor with at least 1 G allele in position CT60 had worse overall survival (56.2% vs 69.8% at 5 years; P = .001; hazard ratio [HR], 3.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75-8.22), due to a higher risk of relapse (P = .049; HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.00-2.93). Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) was more frequent in patients receiving CT60 AA stem cells (P = .033; HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.03-2.29). This is the first study to report an association between polymorphisms at CTLA-4 and clinical outcome after allo-HSCT. The CT60 genotype influences relapse and aGVHD, probably due to its action on CTLA-4 alternative splicing.},

	Abstract = {Previous studies of non-histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on subgroups of patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) revealed an association with transplant outcome. This study further evaluated the association of non-HLA polymorphisms with overall survival in a cohort of 762 HSCT patients using data on 26 polymorphisms in 16 non-HLA genes. When viewed in addition to an already established clinical risk score (EBMT-score), three polymorphisms: rs8177374 in the gene for MyD88-adapter-like (MAL; P=0.026), rs9340799 in the oestrogen receptor gene (ESR; P=0.003) and rs1800795 in interleukin-6 (IL-6; P=0.007) were found to be associated with reduced overall survival, whereas the haplo-genotype (ACC/ACC) in IL-10 was protective (P=0.02). The addition of these non-HLA polymorphisms in a Cox regression model alongside the EBMT-score improved discrimination between risk groups and increased the level of prediction compared with the EBMT-score alone (gain in prediction capability for EBMT-genetic-score 10.8%). Results also demonstrated how changes in clinical practice through time have altered the effects of non-HLA analysis. The study illustrates the significance of non-HLA genotyping prior to HSCT and the importance of further investigation into non-HLA gene polymorphisms in risk prediction. },

	Abstract = {Pro-inflammatory and dendritic cell-activating properties of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) suggest a potentially important role for MIF in alloantigen-specific immune responses after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). We tested whether MIF -173 G/C gene polymorphism of donor or patient had impacts on the outcomes after allo-SCT. Four hundred and fifty-four donor-patient pairs were genotyped and mortality, relapse, and development of complications were analyzed. Patient but not donor MIF -173 *C allele was associated with improved overall survival (OS) (5 years: 60.8% versus 46.3%, p=0.042) and disease free survival (DFS) (5 years: 55.4% versus 39.5%; p=0.014) due to a reduction in relapse (day 2000: 22.8% versus 42.0% p=0.006) but not due to decreased transplantation-related mortality (TRM) (p=0.44). Multivariate analysis proved patient -173 *C allele as an independent factor for reducing relapse after allo-SCT (p=0.023). Subgroup analysis showed a clear MIF -173 *C allele-related reduction in relapse for those patients who did not receive T cell depleted (TCD) SCT (p=0.01) in contrast to patients receiving TCD SCT (p=0.20). In summary, patient MIF -173 *C allele may be linked to specific, yet unrevealed functions in tumor biology and graft versus leukemia and lymphoma effects and potentially presents a novel prognostic marker for patient-tailored counseling and therapy in allo-SCT.},

	Abstract = {Transforming growth factor β-1, encoded by the TGFB1 gene, is a cytokine that plays a central role in many physiological and pathogenic processes. We have sequenced TGFB1 regulatory region and assigned allelic genotypes in a large cohort of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients and donors. In this study, we analyzed 522 unrelated donor-patient pairs and examined the combined effect of all the common polymorphisms in this genomic region. In univariate analysis, we found that patients carrying a specific allele, 'p001', showed significantly reduced overall survival (5-year overall survival 30.7% for p001/p001 patients vs. 41.6% others; P=0.032) and increased non-relapse mortality (1-year non-relapse mortality: 39.0% vs. 25.4%; P=0.039) after transplantation. In multivariate analysis, the presence of a p001/p001 genotype in patients was confirmed as an independent factor for reduced overall survival [hazard ratio=1.53 (1.04-2.24); P=0.031], and increased non-relapse mortality [hazard ratio=1.73 (1.06-2.83); P=0.030]. In functional experiments we found a trend towards a higher percentage of surface transforming growth factor β-1-positive regulatory T cells after activation when the cells had a p001 allele (P=0.07). Higher or lower production of transforming growth factor β-1 in the inflammatory context of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may influence the development of complications in these patients. Findings indicate that TGFB1 genotype could potentially be of use as a prognostic factor in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation risk assessment algorithms. },

	Abstract = {Despite stringent procedures to secure the best HLA matching between donors and recipients, life-threatening complications continue to occur after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Studying single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in genes encoding costimulatory molecules could help identify patients at risk for post-HSCT complications. In a stepwise approach we selected SNPs in key costimulatory molecules including CD274, CD40, CD154, CD28, and TNFSF4 and systematically analyzed their association with post-HSCT outcomes. Our discovery cohort analysis of 1157 HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1 matched cases found that patients with donors homozygous for the C variant of rs10912564 in TNFSF4 (48%) had better disease-free survival (P = .029) and overall survival (P = .009) with less treatment-related mortality (P = .006). Our data demonstrate the TNFSF4C variant had a higher affinity for the nuclear transcription factor Myb and increased percentage of TNFSF4-positive B cells after stimulation compared with CT or TT genotypes. However, these associations were not validated in a more recent cohort, potentially because of changes in standard of practice or absence of a true association. Given the discovery cohort, functional data, and importance of TNFSF4 in infection clearance, TNFSF4C may associate with outcomes and warrants future studies.},

	Abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated that genetic variation in cytokine genes can modulate the immune reactions after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). High mobility group box 1 protein (HMBG1) is a pleiotropic cytokine that functions as a pro-inflammatory signal, important for the activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and propagation of inflammation. HMGB1 is implicated in the pathophysiology of a variety of inflammatory diseases, and we have recently found the variation in the HMGB1 gene to be associated with mortality in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. To assess the impact of the genetic variation in HMGB1 on outcome after allogeneic HCT, we genotyped 276 and 146 patient/donor pairs treated with allogeneic HCT for hematologic malignancies following myeloablative (MA) or nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning. Associations between genotypes and outcome were only observed in the cohort treated with MA conditioning. Patient homozygosity or heterozygosity for the-1377delA minor allele was associated with increased risk of relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 2.11, P = .02) and increased relapse related mortality (RRM) (P = .03). Furthermore, patient homozygosity for the 3814C > G minor allele was associated with increased overall survival (OS; HR 0.13, P = .04), progression free survival (PFS; HR 0.30, P = .05) and decreased probability of RRM (P = .03). Patient carriage of the 2351insT minor allele reduced the risk of grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) (HR 0.60, P = .01), whereas donor homozygosity was associated with chronic GVHD (cGVHD) (HR 1.54, P = .01). Our findings suggest that the inherited variation in HMGB1 is associated with outcome after allogeneic HCT following MA conditioning. None of the polymorphisms were associated with treatment-related mortality (TRM).},

We now extended these studies to assess the role of NOD2/CARD15 SNPs in 342 unrelated donor transplants. Overall, presence of any SNPs in patients or donor resulted in an increased risk of severe GvHD (25% in wildtype versus 38% in recipients and donors with variants, P= 0.01), which did not translate in increased mortality. When the analysis was broken down to individual SNPs, the presence of a SNP13 in the donor turned out to be the only highly significant risk factor (GvHD III/IV 22% wt, 42% SNP13 donor, P < 0.004; TRM 33% wt versus 59% SNP13 donor, P= 0.01; overall survival 49% wt versus 26% SNP13 donor, P= 0.007). This association was confirmed in multivariate analysis. Analysis of clinical risk factors suggested that this effect was most prominent in patients receiving any form of T cell depletion. Thus our observation indicates that the presence of a defect in innate immunity signalling in donor monocytes and possibly antigen presenting cells is most prominent in patients having additional T cell deficiency.},

	Abstract = {Genome-wide scans of nucleotide variation in human subjects are providing an increasing number of replicated associations with complex disease traits. Most of the variants detected have small effects and, collectively, they account for a small fraction of the total genetic variance. Very large sample sizes are required to identify and validate findings. In this situation, even small sources of systematic or random error can cause spurious results or obscure real effects. The need for careful attention to data quality has been appreciated for some time in this field, and a number of strategies for quality control and quality assurance (QC/QA) have been developed. Here we extend these methods and describe a system of QC/QA for genotypic data in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This system includes some new approaches that (1) combine analysis of allelic probe intensities and called genotypes to distinguish gender misidentification from sex chromosome aberrations, (2) detect autosomal chromosome aberrations that may affect genotype calling accuracy, (3) infer DNA sample quality from relatedness and allelic intensities, (4) use duplicate concordance to infer SNP quality, (5) detect genotyping artifacts from dependence of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test P-values on allelic frequency, and (6) demonstrate sensitivity of principal components analysis to SNP selection. The methods are illustrated with examples from the "Gene Environment Association Studies" (GENEVA) program. The results suggest several recommendations for QC/QA in the design and execution of GWAS.},

The importance of chemokines in HSCT lies in their regulation of immune responses that determine transplantation outcomes. We investigated the role of recipient and donor chemokine system gene polymorphisms by using a candidate gene approach on the incidence of graft-versus-host disease and posttransplantation outcomes in 1370 extensively human leukocyte antigen-matched, unrelated donor-recipient pairs by using multivariate Cox regression models. Our analysis identified that recipients homozygous for a common CCR5 haplotype (H1/H1) had better disease-free survival (DFS; P = .005) and overall survival (P = .021). When the same genotype of both the donor and recipient were considered in the models, a highly significant association with DFS and overall survival was noted (P < .001 and P = .007, respectively) with absolute differences in survival of up to 20% seen between the groups at 3 years after transplantation (50% DFS for pairs with recipient CCR5 H1/H1 vs 30% for pairs with donor CCR5 H1/H1). This finding suggests that donor and/or recipient CCR5 genotypes may be associated with HSCT outcome and suggests new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for optimizing therapy.},

	Abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the NOD2/CARD15 gene resulting in a diminished nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) response to bacterial cell wall products have been associated with an increased incidence of Crohn disease. To assess a possible contribution of NOD2/CARD15 mutations to graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and complications following allogeneic stem cell transplantation, we retrospectively typed DNA from donor/recipient pairs in 169 consecutive patients receiving transplants from related or unrelated donors. Mutated alleles were observed in 21% of patients and in 14% of donors. Cumulative incidence of 1-year, transplant-related mortality rose from 20% in donor/recipient pairs without mutated SNPs to 49% in pairs with recipient mutations (P =.03) and 59% in pairs with donor mutations (P <.005), and was highest in 12 pairs with mutated alleles in both donor and recipients (83%; P <.001). Similar associations were observed for severe overall and severe gastrointestinal GvHD. The impact of NOD2/CARD15 mutations was more prominent for HLA-identical sibling transplantations but was also observed in unrelated donor transplantation. Mutations proved to be independent risk factors for transplant-related mortality. Our findings indicate a major role of monocyte/macrophage dysfunction in the pathophysiology of GvHD and strongly suggest a future risk assessment or even donor selection through NOD2/CARD15 typing.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a new statistical model for patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among multiple SNPs in a population sample. The model overcomes limitations of existing approaches to understanding, summarizing, and interpreting LD by (i) relating patterns of LD directly to the underlying recombination process; (ii) considering all loci simultaneously, rather than pairwise; (iii) avoiding the assumption that LD necessarily has a "block-like" structure; and (iv) being computationally tractable for huge genomic regions (up to complete chromosomes). We examine in detail one natural application of the model: estimation of underlying recombination rates from population data. Using simulation, we show that in the case where recombination is assumed constant across the region of interest, recombination rate estimates based on our model are competitive with the very best of current available methods. More importantly, we demonstrate, on real and simulated data, the potential of the model to help identify and quantify fine-scale variation in recombination rate from population data. We also outline how the model could be useful in other contexts, such as in the development of more efficient haplotype-based methods for LD mapping.},

	Abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can identify common alleles that contribute to complex disease susceptibility. Despite the large number of SNPs assessed in each study, the effects of most common SNPs must be evaluated indirectly using either genotyped markers or haplotypes thereof as proxies. We have previously implemented a computationally efficient Markov Chain framework for genotype imputation and haplotyping in the freely available MaCH software package. The approach describes sampled chromosomes as mosaics of each other and uses available genotype and shotgun sequence data to estimate unobserved genotypes and haplotypes, together with useful measures of the quality of these estimates. Our approach is already widely used to facilitate comparison of results across studies as well as meta-analyses of GWAS. Here, we use simulations and experimental genotypes to evaluate its accuracy and utility, considering choices of genotyping panels, reference panel configurations, and designs where genotyping is replaced with shotgun sequencing. Importantly, we show that genotype imputation not only facilitates cross study analyses but also increases power of genetic association studies. We show that genotype imputation of common variants using HapMap haplotypes as a reference is very accurate using either genome-wide SNP data or smaller amounts of data typical in fine-mapping studies. Furthermore, we show the approach is applicable in a variety of populations. Finally, we illustrate how association analyses of unobserved variants will benefit from ongoing advances such as larger HapMap reference panels and whole genome shotgun sequencing technologies.},

@article{durbin_2014,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Over the last few years, methods based on suffix arrays using the Burrows-Wheeler Transform have been widely used for DNA sequence read matching and assembly. These provide very fast search algorithms, linear in the search pattern size, on a highly compressible representation of the dataset being searched. Meanwhile, algorithmic development for genotype data has concentrated on statistical methods for phasing and imputation, based on probabilistic matching to hidden Markov model representations of the reference data, which while powerful are much less computationally efficient. Here a theory of haplotype matching using suffix array ideas is developed, which should scale too much larger datasets than those currently handled by genotype algorithms.
RESULTS: Given M sequences with N bi-allelic variable sites, an O(NM) algorithm to derive a representation of the data based on positional prefix arrays is given, which is termed the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform (PBWT). On large datasets this compresses with run-length encoding by more than a factor of a hundred smaller than using gzip on the raw data. Using this representation a method is given to find all maximal haplotype matches within the set in O(NM) time rather than O(NM(2)) as expected from naive pairwise comparison, and also a fast algorithm, empirically independent of M given sufficient memory for indexes, to find maximal matches between a new sequence and the set. The discussion includes some proposals about how these approaches could be used for imputation and phasing.},

	Abstract = {We present a genotype imputation method that scales to millions of reference samples. The imputation method, based on the Li and Stephens model and implemented in Beagle v.4.1, is parallelized and memory efficient, making it well suited to multi-core computer processors. It achieves fast, accurate, and memory-efficient genotype imputation by restricting the probability model to markers that are genotyped in the target samples and by performing linear interpolation to impute ungenotyped variants. We compare Beagle v.4.1 with Impute2 and Minimac3 by using 1000 Genomes Project data, UK10K Project data, and simulated data. All three methods have similar accuracy but different memory requirements and different computation times. When imputing 10 Mb of sequence data from 50,000 reference samples, Beagle's throughput was more than 100× greater than Impute2's throughput on our computer servers. When imputing 10 Mb of sequence data from 200,000 reference samples in VCF format, Minimac3 consumed 26× more memory per computational thread and 15× more CPU time than Beagle. We demonstrate that Beagle v.4.1 scales to much larger reference panels by performing imputation from a simulated reference panel having 5 million samples and a mean marker density of one marker per four base pairs. },

The map is estimated to capture untyped common variation with an average maximum r2 of between 0.9 and 0.96 depending on population. We demonstrate that the current generation of commercial genome-wide genotyping products captures common Phase II SNPs with an average maximum r2 of up to 0.8 in African and up to 0.95 in non-African populations, and that potential gains in power in association studies can be obtained through imputation. These data also reveal novel aspects of the structure of linkage disequilibrium. We show that 10-30% of pairs of individuals within a population share at least one region of extended genetic identity arising from recent ancestry and that up to 1% of all common variants are untaggable, primarily because they lie within recombination hotspots. We show that recombination rates vary systematically around genes and between genes of different function. Finally, we demonstrate increased differentiation at non-synonymous, compared to synonymous, SNPs, resulting from systematic differences in the strength or efficacy of natural selection between populations.},

	Abstract = {The 1000 Genomes Project aims to provide a deep characterization of human genome sequence variation as a foundation for investigating the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Here we present results of the pilot phase of the project, designed to develop and compare different strategies for genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput platforms. We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother-father-child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast majority of common variation, over 95% of the currently accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be used to inform association and functional studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base substitution mutations to be approximately 10(-8) per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection at linked sites. These methods and public data will support the next phase of human genetic research.},

Do pairwise or multimarker methods maximize efficiency and power? To what extent is power compromised when tags are selected from an incomplete resource such as HapMap? We addressed these questions using genotype data from the HapMap ENCODE project, association studies simulated under a realistic disease model, and empirical correction for multiple hypothesis testing. We demonstrate a haplotype-based tagging method that uniformly outperforms single-marker tests and methods for prioritization that markedly increase tagging efficiency. Examining all observed haplotypes for association, rather than just those that are proxies for known SNPs, increases power to detect rare causal alleles, at the cost of reduced power to detect common causal alleles. Power is robust to the completeness of the reference panel from which tags are selected. These findings have implications for prioritizing tag SNPs and interpreting association studies.},

The primary tools that fuel these new efforts are imputation, allowing researchers who have collected data on a diversity of genotype platforms to share data in a uniformly exchangeable format, and meta-analysis for pooling statistical support for a genotype-phenotype association. As many groups are forming collaborations to engage in these efforts, this review collects a series of guidelines, practical detail and learned experiences from a variety of individuals who have contributed to the subject.},

@article{Reich_2001,
	Abstract = {With the availability of a dense genome-wide map of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a central issue in human genetics is whether it is now possible to use linkage disequilibrium (LD) to map genes that cause disease. LD refers to correlations among neighbouring alleles, reflecting 'haplotypes' descended from single, ancestral chromosomes. The size of LD blocks has been the subject of considerable debate. Computer simulations and empirical data have suggested that LD extends only a few kilobases (kb) around common SNPs, whereas other data have suggested that it can extend much further, in some cases greater than 100 kb. It has been difficult to obtain a systematic picture of LD because past studies have been based on only a few (1-3) loci and different populations. Here, we report a large-scale experiment using a uniform protocol to examine 19 randomly selected genomic regions. LD in a United States population of north-European descent typically extends 60 kb from common alleles, implying that LD mapping is likely to be practical in this population. By contrast, LD in a Nigerian population extends markedly less far. The results illuminate human history, suggesting that LD in northern Europeans is shaped by a marked demographic event about 27,000-53,000 years ago.},

	Abstract = {In this review, we describe recent empirical and theoretical work on the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the human genome, comparing the predictions of simple population-genetic models to available data. Several studies report significant LD over distances longer than those predicted by standard models, whereas some data from short, intergenic regions show less LD than would be expected. The apparent discrepancies between theory and data present a challenge-both to modelers and to human geneticists-to identify which important features are missing from our understanding of the biological processes that give rise to LD. Salient features may include demographic complications such as recent admixture, as well as genetic factors such as local variation in recombination rates, gene conversion, and the potential segregation of inversions. We also outline some implications that the emerging patterns of LD have for association-mapping strategies. In particular, we discuss what marker densities might be necessary for genomewide association scans.},

The roughly 1,200 genes that have been characterized have clarified our understanding of the molecular basis of human genetic disease. The principles derived from these successes should be applied now to strategies aimed at finding the considerably more elusive genes that underlie complex disease phenotypes. The distribution of types of mutation in mendelian disease genes argues for serious consideration of the early application of a genomic-scale sequence-based approach to association studies and against complete reliance on a positional cloning approach based on a map of anonymous single nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes.},

@article{shi_2011,
	Abstract = {A number of large-scale cancer somatic genome sequencing projects are now identifying genetic alterations in cancers. Evaluation of the effects of these mutations is essential for understanding their contribution to tumorigenesis. We have used SNPs3D, a software suite originally developed for analyzing nonsynonymous germ-line variants, to identify single-base mutations with a high impact on protein structure and function. Two machine learning methods are used: one identifying mutations that destabilize protein three-dimensional structure and the other utilizing sequence conservation and detecting all types of effects on in vivo protein function. Incorporation of detailed structure information into the analysis allows detailed interpretation of the functional effects of mutations in specific cases.  Data from a set of breast and colorectal tumors were analyzed. In known cancer genes, mutations approaching 100% of mutations are found to impact protein function, supporting the view that these methods are appropriate for identifying driver mutations. Overall, 50-60% of all somatic missense mutations are predicted to have a high impact on structural stability or to more generally affect the function of the corresponding proteins. This value is similar to the fraction of all possible missense mutations that have a high impact and is much higher than the corresponding one for human population single-nucleotide polymorphisms, at about 30%. The majority of mutations in tumor suppressors destabilize protein structure, while mutations in oncogenes operate in more varied ways, including destabilization of less active conformational states. The set of high-impact mutations encompasses the possible drivers.},

Here we describe an integrated set of eight structural variant classes comprising both balanced and unbalanced variants, which we constructed using short-read DNA sequencing data and statistically phased onto haplotype blocks in 26 human populations. Analysing this set, we identify numerous gene-intersecting structural variants exhibiting population stratification and describe naturally occurring homozygous gene knockouts that suggest the dispensability of a variety of human genes. We demonstrate that structural variants are enriched on haplotypes identified by genome-wide association studies and exhibit enrichment for expression quantitative trait loci. Additionally, we uncover appreciable levels of structural variant complexity at different scales, including genic loci subject to clusters of repeated rearrangement and complex structural variants with multiple breakpoints likely to have formed through individual mutational events. Our catalogue will enhance future studies into structural variant demography, functional impact and disease association. },

	Abstract = {Linkage disequilibrium--the nonrandom association of alleles at different loci--is a sensitive indicator of the population genetic forces that structure a genome. Because of the explosive growth of methods for assessing genetic variation at a fine scale, evolutionary biologists and human geneticists are increasingly exploiting linkage disequilibrium in order to understand past evolutionary and demographic events, to map genes that are associated with quantitative characters and inherited diseases, and to understand the joint evolution of linked sets of genes. This article introduces linkage disequilibrium, reviews the population genetic processes that affect it and describes some of its uses. At present, linkage disequilibrium is used much more extensively in the study of humans than in non-humans, but that is changing as technological advances make extensive genomic studies feasible in other species.},

	Abstract = {Genetic architecture describes the characteristics of genetic variation that are responsible for heritable phenotypic variability. It depends on the number of genetic variants affecting a trait, their frequencies in the population, the magnitude of their effects and their interactions with each other and the environment. Defining the genetic architecture of a complex trait or disease is central to the scientific and clinical goals of human genetics, which are to understand disease aetiology and aid in disease screening, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. Recent technological advances have enabled genome-wide association studies and emerging next-generation sequencing studies to begin to decipher the nature of the heritable contribution to traits and disease. Here, we describe the types of genetic architecture that have been observed, how architecture can be measured and why an improved understanding of genetic architecture is central to future advances in the field.},

Recent trends include increasing use of alternative donors including human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched unrelated persons and HLA-matched umbilical cord blood cells, increasing use of blood cell rather than bone marrow grafts, and increasing use of reduced-intensity pretransplant conditioning regimens. Many of these shifts are driven by logistical considerations such as the need for donors in persons without an HLA-identical sibling or expanding use of allotransplants to older persons. Many changes in transplant practices are not supported by results of large randomized trials. More data are needed to critically-assess the impact of these changes.},

	Abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a highly specialized and unique medical procedure. Autologous transplantation allows the administration of high-dose chemotherapy without prolonged bone marrow aplasia. In allogeneic transplantation, donor-derived stem cells provide alloimmunity that enables a graft-versus-tumor effect to eradicate residual disease and prevent relapse. The first allogeneic transplantation was performed by E. Donnall Thomas in 1957. Since then the field has evolved and expanded worldwide. New indications beside acute leukemia and aplastic anemia have been constantly explored and now include congenital disorders of the hematopoietic system, metabolic disorders, and autoimmune disease. The use of matched unrelated donors, umbilical cord blood units, and partially matched related donors has dramatically extended the availability of allogeneic transplantation. Transplant-related mortality has decreased due to improved supportive care, including better strategies to prevent severe infections and with the incorporation of reduced-intensity conditioning protocols that lowered the toxicity and allowed for transplantation in older patients. However, disease relapse and graft-versus-host disease remain the two major causes of mortality with unsatisfactory progress. Intense research aiming to improve adoptive immunotherapy and increase graft-versus-leukemia response while decreasing graft-versus-host response might bring the next breakthrough in allogeneic transplantation. Strategies of graft manipulation, tumor-associated antigen vaccinations, monoclonal antibodies, and adoptive cellular immunotherapy have already proved clinically efficient. In the following years, allogeneic transplantation is likely to become more complex, more individualized, and more efficient. },

	Abstract = {Previous studies have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. The current study determined whether these associations could be replicated in large cohorts of donors and recipients. Each SNP was tested with cohorts of patients having the same donor type (HLA-matched related, unrelated, or both) reported in the original publication, and testing was limited to the same genome (recipient or donor) and genetic model (dominant, recessive, or allelic) reported in the original study. The 21 SNPs reported in this study represent 19 genes, and the analysis encompassed 22 SNP association tests. The hazard ratio (HR) point estimates and risk ratio point estimates corresponding to odds ratios in previous studies consistently fall outside the 95% confidence intervals of HR estimates in the current study. Despite the large size of the cohorts available for the current study, the 95% confidence intervals for most HRs did not exclude 1.0. Three SNPs representing CTLA4, HPSE, and IL1R1 showed evidence of association with the risk of chronic GVHD in unrelated donor-recipient pairs from 1 cohort, but none of these associations was replicated when tested in unrelated donor-recipient pairs from an independent cohort. Two SNPs representing CCR6 and FGFR1OP showed possible associations with the risk of chronic GVHD in related donor-recipient pairs but not in unrelated donor-recipient pairs. These results remain to be tested for replication in other cohorts of related donor-recipient pairs.},

	Abstract = {Overall survival following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has improved over the past two decades through better patient selection and advances in HLA typing, supportive care, and infection prophylaxis. Nonetheless, mortality rates are still unsatisfactory and transplant-related mortality remains a major cause of death after unrelated allogeneic HCT. Since there are no known pre-HCT, non-HLA biologic predictors of survival following transplant, for over a decade, scientists have been investigating the role of non-HLA germline genetic variation in survival and treatment-related mortality after HCT. Variation in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has the potential to impact chemotherapy, radiation, and immune responses, leading to different post-HCT survival outcomes. In this paper, we address the current knowledge of the contribution of genetic variation to survival following HCT and discuss study design and methodology for investigating HCT survival on a genomic scale. },

	Abstract = {As the sequencing of healthy and disease genomes becomes more commonplace, detailed annotation provides interpretation for individual variation responsible for normal and disease phenotypes. Current approaches focus on direct changes in protein coding genes, particularly nonsynonymous mutations that directly affect the gene product. However, most individual variation occurs outside of genes and, indeed, most markers generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify variants outside of coding segments. Identification of potential regulatory changes that perturb these sites will lead to a better localization of truly functional variants and interpretation of their effects. We have developed a novel approach and database, RegulomeDB, which guides interpretation of regulatory variants in the human genome. RegulomeDB includes high-throughput, experimental data sets from ENCODE and other sources, as well as computational predictions and manual annotations to identify putative regulatory potential and identify functional variants. These data sources are combined into a powerful tool that scores variants to help separate functional variants from a large pool and provides a small set of putative sites with testable hypotheses as to their function. We demonstrate the applicability of this tool to the annotation of noncoding variants from 69 full sequenced genomes as well as that of a personal genome, where thousands of functionally associated variants were identified. Moreover, we demonstrate a GWAS where the database is able to quickly identify the known associated functional variant and provide a hypothesis as to its function. Overall, we expect this approach and resource to be valuable for the annotation of human genome sequences.},

	Abstract = {Gene-based tests such as versatile gene-based association study (VEGAS) are commonly used following per-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) GWAS (genome-wide association studies) analysis. Two limitations of VEGAS were that the HapMap2 reference set was used to model the correlation between SNPs and only autosomal genes were considered. HapMap2 has now been superseded by the 1,000 Genomes reference set, and whereas early GWASs frequently ignored the X chromosome, it is now commonly included. Here we have developed VEGAS2, an extension that uses 1,000 Genomes data to model SNP correlations across the autosomes and chromosome X. VEGAS2 allows greater flexibility when defining gene boundaries. VEGAS2 offers both a user-friendly, web-based front end and a command line Linux version. The online version of VEGAS2 can be accessed through https://vegas2.qimrberghofer.edu.au/. The command line version can be downloaded from https://vegas2.qimrberghofer.edu.au/zVEGAS2offline.tgz. The command line version is developed in Perl, R and shell scripting languages; source code is available for further development. },

	Abstract = {The rapid growth of human genetics creates countless opportunities for studies of disease association. Given the number of potentially identifiable genetic markers and the multitude of clinical outcomes to which these may be linked, the testing and validation of statistical hypotheses in genetic epidemiology is a task of unprecedented scale. Meta-analysis provides a quantitative approach for combining the results of various studies on the same topic, and for estimating and explaining their diversity. Here, we have evaluated by meta-analysis 370 studies addressing 36 genetic associations for various outcomes of disease. We show that significant between-study heterogeneity (diversity) is frequent, and that the results of the first study correlate only modestly with subsequent research on the same association. The first study often suggests a stronger genetic effect than is found by subsequent studies. Both bias and genuine population diversity might explain why early association studies tend to overestimate the disease protection or predisposition conferred by a genetic polymorphism. We conclude that a systematic meta-analytic approach may assist in estimating population-wide effects of genetic risk factors in human disease.},

@article{Howie_2009,
	Abstract = {Genotype imputation methods are now being widely used in the analysis of genome-wide association studies. Most imputation analyses to date have used the HapMap as a reference dataset, but new reference panels (such as controls genotyped on multiple SNP chips and densely typed samples from the 1,000 Genomes Project) will soon allow a broader range of SNPs to be imputed with higher accuracy, thereby increasing power. We describe a genotype imputation method (IMPUTE version 2) that is designed to address the challenges presented by these new datasets. The main innovation of our approach is a flexible modelling framework that increases accuracy and combines information across multiple reference panels while remaining computationally feasible. We find that IMPUTE v2 attains higher accuracy than other methods when the HapMap provides the sole reference panel, but that the size of the panel constrains the improvements that can be made. We also find that imputation accuracy can be greatly enhanced by expanding the reference panel to contain thousands of chromosomes and that IMPUTE v2 outperforms other methods in this setting at both rare and common SNPs, with overall error rates that are 15%-20% lower than those of the closest competing method. One particularly challenging aspect of next-generation association studies is to integrate information across multiple reference panels genotyped on different sets of SNPs; we show that our approach to this problem has practical advantages over other suggested solutions.},

We describe a method that enables explicit detection and correction of population stratification on a genome-wide scale. Our method uses principal components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls. The resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker's variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations. Our simple, efficient approach can easily be applied to disease studies with hundreds of thousands of markers.},

@article{OSAT,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Batch effect is one type of variability that is not of primary interest but ubiquitous in sizable genomic experiments. To minimize the impact of batch effects, an ideal experiment design should ensure the even distribution of biological groups and confounding factors across batches. However, due to the practical complications, the availability of the final collection of samples in genomics study might be unbalanced and incomplete, which, without appropriate attention in sample-to-batch allocation, could lead to drastic batch effects. Therefore, it is necessary to develop effective and handy tool to assign collected samples across batches in an appropriate way in order to minimize the impact of batch effects.
RESULTS: We describe OSAT (Optimal Sample Assignment Tool), a bioconductor package designed for automated sample-to-batch allocations in genomics experiments.
CONCLUSIONS: OSAT is developed to facilitate the allocation of collected samples to different batches in genomics study. Through optimizing the even distribution of samples in groups of biological interest into different batches, it can reduce the confounding or correlation between batches and the biological variables of interest. It can also optimize the homogeneous distribution of confounding factors across batches. It can handle challenging instances where incomplete and unbalanced sample collections are involved as well as ideally balanced designs.},

@article{Hahn_2015,
	Abstract = {Clinical trials commonly use adjudication committees to refine endpoints, but observational research or genome-wide association studies rarely do. Our goals were to establish definitions of cause-specific death after unrelated-donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (URD-HCT), to estimate discordance between reported and adjudicated cause-specific death, and to identify factors contributing to inconsistency in cause-specific death determination. A consensus panel adjudicated cause-specific death in 1484 patients who died within 1 year after HCT, derived from 3532 acute leukemia or myelodysplasia patients after URD-HCT from 2000 to 2011 reported by 151 US transplant centers to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. Deaths were classified as disease-related or transplant-related. The panel agreed with >99% of deaths reported by centers as disease-related and 80% reported as transplant-related. Year of transplant (cohort effect) and disease status significantly influenced agreement between the panel and centers. Sensitivity analysis of deaths < 100 days post-transplant yielded the lowest agreement between the panel and centers for myelodysplastic syndrome patients. Standard predefined criteria for adjudicating cause-specific death led to consistent application to similar clinical scenarios and clearer delineation of cause-specific death categories. Other studies of competing events such as cancer-specific versus treatment-related mortality would benefit from our results. Our detailed algorithm should result in more consistent reporting of cause-specific death by centers. },

To decrease the number of iterations needed for convergence when optimizing the parameter estimates in the Cox model we modified the R package survival; covariates in the model are first fit without the SNP, and those parameter estimates are used as initial points. We benchmarked gwasurvivr with other software capable of conducting genome wide survival analysis (genipe, SurvivalGWAS_SV, and GWASTools). gwasurvivr is significantly faster and shows better scalability as sample size, number of SNPs and number of covariates increases.
