In this report, we provide information about the number of HCT procedures performed in the United States in 2015, and analyze trends and outcomes of HCT as reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). We show that the number of HCTs performed annually continues to increase, as the indications for HCT, preferred donor sources, and graft-versus-host prophylaxis continue to evolve. We report on general overall survival by indication, by disease status at transplantation, and by transplant type. This report provides a current perspective on transplantation activity in the United States with a focus on recent trends in alternative donors and contemporary transplantation practices.},

Recent trends include increasing use of alternative donors including human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched unrelated persons and HLA-matched umbilical cord blood cells, increasing use of blood cell rather than bone marrow grafts, and increasing use of reduced-intensity pretransplant conditioning regimens. Many of these shifts are driven by logistical considerations such as the need for donors in persons without an HLA-identical sibling or expanding use of allotransplants to older persons. Many changes in transplant practices are not supported by results of large randomized trials. More data are needed to critically-assess the impact of these changes.},

@article{Henig_2014,
	Abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a highly specialized and unique medical procedure. Autologous transplantation allows the administration of high-dose chemotherapy without prolonged bone marrow aplasia. In allogeneic transplantation, donor-derived stem cells provide alloimmunity that enables a graft-versus-tumor effect to eradicate residual disease and prevent relapse. The first allogeneic transplantation was performed by E. Donnall Thomas in 1957. Since then the field has evolved and expanded worldwide. New indications beside acute leukemia and aplastic anemia have been constantly explored and now include congenital disorders of the hematopoietic system, metabolic disorders, and autoimmune disease. The use of matched unrelated donors, umbilical cord blood units, and partially matched related donors has dramatically extended the availability of allogeneic transplantation. Transplant-related mortality has decreased due to improved supportive care, including better strategies to prevent severe infections and with the incorporation of reduced-intensity conditioning protocols that lowered the toxicity and allowed for transplantation in older patients. However, disease relapse and graft-versus-host disease remain the two major causes of mortality with unsatisfactory progress. Intense research aiming to improve adoptive immunotherapy and increase graft-versus-leukemia response while decreasing graft-versus-host response might bring the next breakthrough in allogeneic transplantation. Strategies of graft manipulation, tumor-associated antigen vaccinations, monoclonal antibodies, and adoptive cellular immunotherapy have already proved clinically efficient. In the following years, allogeneic transplantation is likely to become more complex, more individualized, and more efficient. },

@article{Martin:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Previous studies have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. The current study determined whether these associations could be replicated in large cohorts of donors and recipients. Each SNP was tested with cohorts of patients having the same donor type (HLA-matched related, unrelated, or both) reported in the original publication, and testing was limited to the same genome (recipient or donor) and genetic model (dominant, recessive, or allelic) reported in the original study. The 21 SNPs reported in this study represent 19 genes, and the analysis encompassed 22 SNP association tests. The hazard ratio (HR) point estimates and risk ratio point estimates corresponding to odds ratios in previous studies consistently fall outside the 95% confidence intervals of HR estimates in the current study. Despite the large size of the cohorts available for the current study, the 95% confidence intervals for most HRs did not exclude 1.0. Three SNPs representing CTLA4, HPSE, and IL1R1 showed evidence of association with the risk of chronic GVHD in unrelated donor-recipient pairs from 1 cohort, but none of these associations was replicated when tested in unrelated donor-recipient pairs from an independent cohort. Two SNPs representing CCR6 and FGFR1OP showed possible associations with the risk of chronic GVHD in related donor-recipient pairs but not in unrelated donor-recipient pairs. These results remain to be tested for replication in other cohorts of related donor-recipient pairs.},

@article{Sucheston-Campbell:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Overall survival following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has improved over the past two decades through better patient selection and advances in HLA typing, supportive care, and infection prophylaxis. Nonetheless, mortality rates are still unsatisfactory and transplant-related mortality remains a major cause of death after unrelated allogeneic HCT. Since there are no known pre-HCT, non-HLA biologic predictors of survival following transplant, for over a decade, scientists have been investigating the role of non-HLA germline genetic variation in survival and treatment-related mortality after HCT. Variation in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has the potential to impact chemotherapy, radiation, and immune responses, leading to different post-HCT survival outcomes. In this paper, we address the current knowledge of the contribution of genetic variation to survival following HCT and discuss study design and methodology for investigating HCT survival on a genomic scale. },

@article{Boyle_2012,
	Abstract = {As the sequencing of healthy and disease genomes becomes more commonplace, detailed annotation provides interpretation for individual variation responsible for normal and disease phenotypes. Current approaches focus on direct changes in protein coding genes, particularly nonsynonymous mutations that directly affect the gene product. However, most individual variation occurs outside of genes and, indeed, most markers generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify variants outside of coding segments. Identification of potential regulatory changes that perturb these sites will lead to a better localization of truly functional variants and interpretation of their effects. We have developed a novel approach and database, RegulomeDB, which guides interpretation of regulatory variants in the human genome. RegulomeDB includes high-throughput, experimental data sets from ENCODE and other sources, as well as computational predictions and manual annotations to identify putative regulatory potential and identify functional variants. These data sources are combined into a powerful tool that scores variants to help separate functional variants from a large pool and provides a small set of putative sites with testable hypotheses as to their function. We demonstrate the applicability of this tool to the annotation of noncoding variants from 69 full sequenced genomes as well as that of a personal genome, where thousands of functionally associated variants were identified. Moreover, we demonstrate a GWAS where the database is able to quickly identify the known associated functional variant and provide a hypothesis as to its function. Overall, we expect this approach and resource to be valuable for the annotation of human genome sequences.},

@article{Mishra_2015,
	Abstract = {Gene-based tests such as versatile gene-based association study (VEGAS) are commonly used following per-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) GWAS (genome-wide association studies) analysis. Two limitations of VEGAS were that the HapMap2 reference set was used to model the correlation between SNPs and only autosomal genes were considered. HapMap2 has now been superseded by the 1,000 Genomes reference set, and whereas early GWASs frequently ignored the X chromosome, it is now commonly included. Here we have developed VEGAS2, an extension that uses 1,000 Genomes data to model SNP correlations across the autosomes and chromosome X. VEGAS2 allows greater flexibility when defining gene boundaries. VEGAS2 offers both a user-friendly, web-based front end and a command line Linux version. The online version of VEGAS2 can be accessed through https://vegas2.qimrberghofer.edu.au/. The command line version can be downloaded from https://vegas2.qimrberghofer.edu.au/zVEGAS2offline.tgz. The command line version is developed in Perl, R and shell scripting languages; source code is available for further development. },

	Abstract = {The rapid growth of human genetics creates countless opportunities for studies of disease association. Given the number of potentially identifiable genetic markers and the multitude of clinical outcomes to which these may be linked, the testing and validation of statistical hypotheses in genetic epidemiology is a task of unprecedented scale. Meta-analysis provides a quantitative approach for combining the results of various studies on the same topic, and for estimating and explaining their diversity. Here, we have evaluated by meta-analysis 370 studies addressing 36 genetic associations for various outcomes of disease. We show that significant between-study heterogeneity (diversity) is frequent, and that the results of the first study correlate only modestly with subsequent research on the same association. The first study often suggests a stronger genetic effect than is found by subsequent studies. Both bias and genuine population diversity might explain why early association studies tend to overestimate the disease protection or predisposition conferred by a genetic polymorphism. We conclude that a systematic meta-analytic approach may assist in estimating population-wide effects of genetic risk factors in human disease.},

@article{Howie_2009,
	Abstract = {Genotype imputation methods are now being widely used in the analysis of genome-wide association studies. Most imputation analyses to date have used the HapMap as a reference dataset, but new reference panels (such as controls genotyped on multiple SNP chips and densely typed samples from the 1,000 Genomes Project) will soon allow a broader range of SNPs to be imputed with higher accuracy, thereby increasing power. We describe a genotype imputation method (IMPUTE version 2) that is designed to address the challenges presented by these new datasets. The main innovation of our approach is a flexible modelling framework that increases accuracy and combines information across multiple reference panels while remaining computationally feasible. We find that IMPUTE v2 attains higher accuracy than other methods when the HapMap provides the sole reference panel, but that the size of the panel constrains the improvements that can be made. We also find that imputation accuracy can be greatly enhanced by expanding the reference panel to contain thousands of chromosomes and that IMPUTE v2 outperforms other methods in this setting at both rare and common SNPs, with overall error rates that are 15%-20% lower than those of the closest competing method. One particularly challenging aspect of next-generation association studies is to integrate information across multiple reference panels genotyped on different sets of SNPs; we show that our approach to this problem has practical advantages over other suggested solutions.},

We describe a method that enables explicit detection and correction of population stratification on a genome-wide scale. Our method uses principal components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls. The resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker's variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations. Our simple, efficient approach can easily be applied to disease studies with hundreds of thousands of markers.},

@article{OSAT,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Batch effect is one type of variability that is not of primary interest but ubiquitous in sizable genomic experiments. To minimize the impact of batch effects, an ideal experiment design should ensure the even distribution of biological groups and confounding factors across batches. However, due to the practical complications, the availability of the final collection of samples in genomics study might be unbalanced and incomplete, which, without appropriate attention in sample-to-batch allocation, could lead to drastic batch effects. Therefore, it is necessary to develop effective and handy tool to assign collected samples across batches in an appropriate way in order to minimize the impact of batch effects.
RESULTS: We describe OSAT (Optimal Sample Assignment Tool), a bioconductor package designed for automated sample-to-batch allocations in genomics experiments.
CONCLUSIONS: OSAT is developed to facilitate the allocation of collected samples to different batches in genomics study. Through optimizing the even distribution of samples in groups of biological interest into different batches, it can reduce the confounding or correlation between batches and the biological variables of interest. It can also optimize the homogeneous distribution of confounding factors across batches. It can handle challenging instances where incomplete and unbalanced sample collections are involved as well as ideally balanced designs.},

@article{Hahn_2015,
	Abstract = {Clinical trials commonly use adjudication committees to refine endpoints, but observational research or genome-wide association studies rarely do. Our goals were to establish definitions of cause-specific death after unrelated-donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (URD-HCT), to estimate discordance between reported and adjudicated cause-specific death, and to identify factors contributing to inconsistency in cause-specific death determination. A consensus panel adjudicated cause-specific death in 1484 patients who died within 1 year after HCT, derived from 3532 acute leukemia or myelodysplasia patients after URD-HCT from 2000 to 2011 reported by 151 US transplant centers to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. Deaths were classified as disease-related or transplant-related. The panel agreed with >99% of deaths reported by centers as disease-related and 80% reported as transplant-related. Year of transplant (cohort effect) and disease status significantly influenced agreement between the panel and centers. Sensitivity analysis of deaths < 100 days post-transplant yielded the lowest agreement between the panel and centers for myelodysplastic syndrome patients. Standard predefined criteria for adjudicating cause-specific death led to consistent application to similar clinical scenarios and clearer delineation of cause-specific death categories. Other studies of competing events such as cancer-specific versus treatment-related mortality would benefit from our results. Our detailed algorithm should result in more consistent reporting of cause-specific death by centers. },

To decrease the number of iterations needed for convergence when optimizing the parameter estimates in the Cox model we modified the R package survival; covariates in the model are first fit without the SNP, and those parameter estimates are used as initial points. We benchmarked gwasurvivr with other software capable of conducting genome wide survival analysis (genipe, SurvivalGWAS_SV, and GWASTools). gwasurvivr is significantly faster and shows better scalability as sample size, number of SNPs and number of covariates increases.
